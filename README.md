# Part A:  Access the API's and Fetch the Data

## Step 1: Retrieve Road Safety Data via CURL

### Purpose:
Retrieve structured road fatalities data in JSON-stat format from the API endpoint for analysis and visualization.

### Command Used:
To make the GET request via Command Prompt, the following CURL command was executed:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/ROA29/JSON-stat/1.0/en" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```
This command fetched the data and displayed the results directly in the terminal.

### Reference:
[CURL Documentation](https://curl.se/)

## Step 2: Retrieve Data Using Postman

### Purpose:
Use Postman to interact with the API and retrieve road fatalities data in JSON-stat format for analysis and visualization.

### Command Used:
The following steps were executed in Postman:

- Opened Postman and created a new request.
- Selected the HTTP method as GET.
- Pasted the URL: https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/ROA29/JSON-stat/1.0/en.
- Set the Content-Type header to application/json.
- Sent the request and reviewed the JSON-stat response displayed in Postman.

### What the Command Did:
The GET request fetched structured data from the API endpoint. The response provided detailed road fatalities information, formatted as JSON-stat, which can be further processed for analysis.

### Why It Was Necessary:
This step was critical for verifying the API's functionality and ensuring the data was accessible in a structured format suitable for parsing and visualization.

### Reference:
[Postman Documentation](https://www.postman.com/)

## Step 3: Parse and Convert Data

### Purpose:
Process the retrieved JSON-stat data and convert it into a structured CSV format for monthly road fatalities analysis.

### Code Used:
The following Python code was implemented to parse the JSON-stat response, structure the data, and save it as a CSV file:
```bash
import requests
import csv
import os

# API endpoint
url = "https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/ROA29/JSON-stat/1.0/en"

# Fetch data using GET request
response = requests.get(url, headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"})

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()  # Parse JSON response
    print("Data retrieved successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch data. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    exit()

# Parse the JSON-stat response for road fatalities
values = data["dataset"]["value"]
months = data["dataset"]["dimension"]["TLIST(M1)"]["category"]["label"]

# Combine data into a structured format
formatted_data = []
for index, fatalities in enumerate(values):
    month = months[str(list(months.keys())[index])]
    formatted_data.append({"Month": month, "Fatalities": int(fatalities)})  # Convert to integer

# Save the structured data to a CSV file
output_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../data")  # Relative directory
output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, "road_fatalities.csv")
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)  # Ensure the directory exists

with open(output_file, mode="w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Month", "Fatalities"])  # Header row
    for entry in formatted_data:
        writer.writerow([entry["Month"], entry["Fatalities"]])

print(f"Data successfully saved to {output_file}")
# The data is now saved in the CSV file, ready for further analysis or visualization.
```
### What the Code Did:

- Parsed the JSON-stat data from the API to extract monthly road fatalities and their corresponding labels.
- Organized the data into a structured format with months and fatality counts.
- Saved the processed data into a CSV file (road_fatalities.csv) within a specified directory (../data).

### Why It Was Necessary:
Converting the data into a CSV format allows for easy analysis, visualization, and compatibility with tools such as spreadsheets or Python libraries like pandas

## Step 4: Monthly Trend Analysis

### Purpose:
Analyze the monthly road fatalities data by grouping it to identify patterns or trends. This step provides insights into variations over time and can serve as a basis for further statistical analysis or visualization.

### Code Used:
The following Python code loads, filters, and analyzes the data saved in the CSV file and saves the filtered results as a new CSV file for the specified years:

```bash
import pandas as pd
import os

# Construct the relative path to the CSV file
csv_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../data/road_fatalities.csv")

# Load data from CSV
df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)

# Split the "Month" column into "Year" and "Month" columns
df["Year"] = df["Month"].str.split(" ").str[0]  # Extract Year
df["Month"] = df["Month"].str.split(" ").str[1]  # Extract Month

# Filter the DataFrame to include only rows corresponding to years 2024 to 2020
filtered_years = ["2024", "2023", "2022", "2021", "2020"]
filtered_df = df[df["Year"].isin(filtered_years)]  # Filter for relevant years

# Save the filtered data to a new Excel sheet
output_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../data/five_yr_fatalities.csv")
filtered_df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)  # Write to CSV without the index column

print(f"Filtered data successfully saved to {output_file}")

```
### What the Code did:
- **Load CSV File:** Reads the road_fatalities.csv file into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
- **Extract Year and Month:**  Splits the "Month" column into two parts: "Year" and "Month". The year and month are extracted using the str.split() method.
- **Filter Relevant Data:** Filters the DataFrame to include only rows corresponding to the years 2024 to 2020 by checking if the "Year" column values are in the specified range.
- **Save Filtered Data:** Saves the filtered data into a new CSV file titled five_yr_fatalities.csv. This new file is stored in the same directory as the original file, making it easy to locate and use for further analysis or sharing.

### Why It Was Necessary:
Filtering the data to focus on the years 2024 to 2020 narrows the scope to the most recent and relevant period for analysis. Saving the filtered results into a new file ensures a clear, reusable dataset that can be used for further analysis or visualization. This cleaned format simplifies the exploration of trends and patterns.

## Step 5 Retrieve population data from the CSO API 
Retrieve population data from the CSO API in JSON-stat format, parse the data, and export it to an Excel sheet for visualization and analysis

### Code Used:
The following Python code was implemented to parse the JSON-stat response, structure the data, and save it as a CSV file:

```bash
import requests
import pandas as pd
import os

# API endpoint URL
url = "https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.jsonrpc"

# POST request payload
payload = {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset",
    "params": {
        "class": "query",
        "id": ["TLIST(A1)", "C02076V02508", "C02199V02655"],
        "dimension": {
            "TLIST(A1)": {"category": {"index": ["2024", "2023", "2022", "2021", "2020"]}},
            "C02076V02508": {"category": {"index": ["-"]}},
            "C02199V02655": {"category": {"index": ["-"]}},
        },
        "extension": {
            "pivot": None,
            "codes": False,
            "language": {"code": "en"},
            "format": {"type": "JSON-stat", "version": "2.0"},
            "matrix": "PEA01"
        },
        "version": "2.0"
    }
}

# Send POST request to the API
response = requests.post(url, json=payload)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()  # Parse JSON-stat response
    print("Population data retrieved successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Failed to fetch data. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    exit()

# Parse and structure data
values = data["result"]["value"]  # Population values
years = data["result"]["dimension"]["TLIST(A1)"]["category"]["label"]  # Year labels

# Combine data into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({"Year": list(years.values()), "Population (Thousand)": values})

# Save to a CSV file
output_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../data")  # Relative directory
output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, "population_breakdown.csv")
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)  # Ensure the directory exists

df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
print(f"Population data successfully saved to {output_file}")
```

### What the Code did:
- **Retrieves Data:** Uses a POST request to interact with the CSO API and fetch population data for the years 2020â€“2024.
- **Structures Data:** Parses the JSON-stat response, organizes the population data alongside year labels, and stores them in a pandas DataFrame.
- **Exports Data:** Writes the DataFrame into an Excel file (population_breakdown.csv) within the ../data directory for convenient storage and usage.

### Why is it necessary:
Converting population data into a structured CSV format ensures compatibility with a wide range of analytical tools and platforms, such as Python, Excel, or data visualization software.

## PART B : Analysis

### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to examine road fatalities over the last five years, identify trends, and visualize the data. The analysis includes detecting increases or decreases in fatalities, splitting the data into quarters for better insights, and saving the results for further use. The results are presented in a line graph with quarterly splits and saved as a CSV file for trend analysis.

### Code Used:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import os

# Load the data
csv_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../data/five_yr_fatalities.csv")
df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)

# Group data by Year and Month to calculate total fatalities
df_grouped = df.groupby(["Year", "Month"], as_index=False).sum()

# Sort the data by Year and Month for proper visualization
month_order = [
    "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
    "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"
]
df_grouped["Month"] = pd.Categorical(df_grouped["Month"], categories=month_order, ordered=True)
df_grouped = df_grouped.sort_values(by=["Year", "Month"])

# Detect increases or decreases in fatalities
df_grouped["Change"] = df_grouped["Fatalities"].diff().fillna(0)  # Calculate the difference between consecutive rows
df_grouped["Trend"] = df_grouped["Change"].apply(lambda x: "Increase" if x > 0 else "Decrease" if x < 0 else "No Change")

# Save the trend data to a CSV file
trend_data_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../data/fatality_trends.csv")
df_grouped.to_csv(trend_data_file, index=False)
print(f"Trend data saved to {trend_data_file}")

# Visualization: Line plot for fatalities over time with quarterly splits
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=df_grouped, x="Month", y="Fatalities", hue="Year", marker="o")

# Add vertical lines to split quarters
quarter_splits = ["March", "June", "September"]
for quarter in quarter_splits:
    plt.axvline(x=quarter, color="red", linestyle="--", alpha=0.7)

# Annotate quarters
plt.text(1.5, df_grouped["Fatalities"].max() + 2, "Q1", ha="center", fontsize=10, color="black")
plt.text(4.5, df_grouped["Fatalities"].max() + 2, "Q2", ha="center", fontsize=10, color="black")
plt.text(7.5, df_grouped["Fatalities"].max() + 2, "Q3", ha="center", fontsize=10, color="black")
plt.text(10.5, df_grouped["Fatalities"].max() + 2, "Q4", ha="center", fontsize=10, color="black")

# Add labels to the points (totals over each value)
for i, row in df_grouped.iterrows():
    plt.text(row["Month"], row["Fatalities"] + 0.5, str(row["Fatalities"]), ha="center", fontsize=8)

# Chart details
plt.title("Monthly Road Fatalities Over the Last 5 Years with Quarterly Splits")
plt.xlabel("Month")
plt.ylabel("Fatalities")
plt.legend(title="Year")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()

# Save the graph to the data folder
graph_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../data/fatalities_trend_graph.png")
plt.savefig(graph_file)
print(f"Graph saved to {graph_file}")

plt.show()
```

### What the Code Did:

1. **Load Data**:
   - The code reads the `five_yr_fatalities.csv` file, which contains monthly road fatalities data for the last five years.

2. **Group and Sort Data**:
   - Groups the data by `Year` and `Month` to calculate total fatalities for each month.
   - Sorts the months in calendar order for proper visualization.

3. **Detect Trends**:
   - Calculates the change in fatalities between consecutive months.
   - Categorizes the trend as "Increase," "Decrease," or "No Change."

4. **Save Trend Data**:
   - Saves the grouped and processed data, including the trend information, to a CSV file named fatality_trends.csv.

5. **Visualize Data**:
   - Creates a line graph showing monthly fatalities for each year.
   - Adds vertical dashed lines to split the graph into quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
   - Annotates the quarters and adds labels above each data point to display the exact fatality totals.

6. **Save Graph**:
   - Saves the graph as an image file (`fatalities_trend_graph.png`) in the `data` folder.

### Output:

#### 1. **Trend Data (`fatality_trends.csv`)**:
The trend data includes the following columns:
- `Year`: The year of the data.
- `Month`: The month of the data.
- `Fatalities`: The total fatalities for the month.
- `Change`: The difference in fatalities compared to the previous month.
- `Trend`: Indicates whether the fatalities increased, decreased, or remained the same.

Example:
```csv
Year,Month,Fatalities,Change,Trend
2020,January,9,0.0,No Change
2020,February,19,10.0,Increase
2020,March,17,-2.0,Decrease
...
```

#### 2. **Graph (`fatalities_trend_graph.png`)**:
- A line graph showing monthly fatalities for each year.
- Vertical dashed lines split the graph into quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4).
- Labels above each data point display the exact fatality totals.

### Why It Was Necessary:
- **Trend Analysis**: Helps identify patterns in road fatalities over time, such as seasonal trends or sudden spikes.
- **Quarterly Insights**: Splitting the data into quarters provides a clearer understanding of how fatalities vary throughout the year.
- **Data Storage**: Saving the trend data and graph ensures the results are reusable for further analysis or reporting.

## PART C

A functional CRUD API for managing road fatalities data using Flask and Flask-RESTful is designed to efficiently handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on road fatalities records. This API ensures seamless data management and enables users to interact with road fatalities data through a user-friendly and scalable interface. It supports data validation, modular design, and integration with external tools like Postman for testing and documentation, making it suitable for analysis, visualization, and tracking trends over time.

Below are the steps and functionalities implemented in the code:

### 1. Setup and Initialization
**Flask and Flask-RESTful:**
- The Flask framework is used to create the web application.
- Flask-RESTful simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs by providing a Resource class for defining endpoints.
**App Initialization:**
- app = Flask(__name__) initializes the Flask application.
- api = Api(app) initializes the RESTful API.

### 2. In-Memory Data Store
**Purpose:**
- The data_store list is used as a temporary in-memory database to store road fatalities data.
**Each record contains:**
- id: A unique identifier for the record.
- year: The year of the record.
- month: The month of the record.
- fatalities: The number of fatalities for that month.
**Auto-Increment ID:**
The next_id variable ensures that each new record gets a unique id.

### 3. CRUD Operations
The FatalitiesResource class defines the CRUD operations for managing the data.

#### a. READ (GET)
**Functionality:**
- Fetches all records or a specific record by id.
- If an id is provided as a query parameter, it searches for the record with that id.
- If no id is provided, it returns all records.
**Error Handling:**
- Returns a 404 status code with a "Record not found" message if the record does not exist.

#### b. CREATE (POST)
**Functionality:**
- Accepts a JSON payload to create a new record.
- Adds the record to the data_store with a unique id.
**Validation:**
- Ensures that the required fields (year, month, fatalities) are present in the request.
- Validates that fatalities is a non-negative integer.
**Response:**
- Returns a 201 status code with a success message and the created record.

#### c. UPDATE (PUT)
**Functionality:**
- Updates an existing record by id with the provided JSON payload.
- earches for the record with the specified id and updates its fields.
**Error Handling:**
- Returns a 404 status code with a "Record not found" message if the record does not exist.
**Response:**
- Returns a 200 status code with a success message and the updated record.

#### d. DELETE (DELETE)
**Functionality:**
- Deletes a record by id.
- Removes the record from the data_store.
**Error Handling:**
- Returns a 404 status code with a "Record not found" message if the record does not exist.
**Response:**
- Returns a 200 status code with a success message.

### 4. API Routes

**Endpoints:**
- /api/fatalities: Handles GET and POST requests.
- /api/fatalities/<int:record_id>: Handles PUT and DELETE requests for a specific record by id.

**Route Registration:**
api.add_resource(FatalitiesResource, '/api/fatalities', '/api/fatalities/<int:record_id>') registers the resource with the specified routes.

### 5. Running the Application
**Debug Mode:**
- The application runs in debug mode (app.run(debug=True)), which provides detailed error messages and auto-reloads the server during development.
**Access:**
- The API is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/fatalities.

### Code used
The following is the code used

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_restful import Resource, Api

app = Flask(__name__)

    def get(self):
        record_id = request.args.get('id')
        if record_id:
            record = next((item for item in data_store if item["id"] == int(record_id)), None)
            if record:
                return record, 200
            return {"message": "Record not found"}, 404
        return data_store, 200

    # CREATE: Add a new record
    def post(self):
        global next_id
        new_record = request.json
